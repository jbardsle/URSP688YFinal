# URSP688YFinal
Final Project for URSP688Y

This repo uses Opportunity Site polygons provided by NCSG, census block files provided by ESRI Living Atlas,
and parcel files provided by Prince George's County.

The code produces estimates of customers/households within a three mile radius of origin sites within Prince George's County, and decays the number of customers based on distance. It also estimates the number of Hispanic customers.
